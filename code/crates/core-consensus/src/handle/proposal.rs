/// Handles an incoming consensus proposal message.
///
/// This handler processes proposals that can arrive from three sources:
/// 1. Network messages from other nodes
/// 2. Local proposals when this node is the proposer
/// 3. WAL replay during node restart
///
/// When acting as proposer (2), consensus core interacts with the application to get a proposed value for the current height and round.
/// In this case the proposal message is sent out to the network but also back to the consensus core.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `co` - The context object containing configuration and external dependencies
/// * `state` - The current consensus state
/// * `metrics` - Metrics collection for monitoring
/// * `signed_proposal` - The signed proposal message to process
///
/// # Flow
/// 1. Validates proposal height and signature
/// 2. Queues messages if not ready to process (wrong height/round)
/// 3. Stores valid proposals and updates WAL if needed
/// 4. Processes the proposal through the driver if a full proposal is available
